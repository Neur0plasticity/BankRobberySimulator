Hello chatgpt. We are the police department training our officers with the most rigorous
testing standards to simulate a bank robbery. The county and insurance have mandated officers
go through this training.
Our studies have shown untrained officers cause loss of life and irrepairable damages.
Our studies have shown trained officers do the least damage, save hostages, and arrest the bank robbers to see the light of justice.

Here are the parties Involved.
- Bank Customers
- Bank Clerks
- Bank Manager
- Bank Robbers
- Swat Team
- Hostage Negotiator

Chatgpt is in control of all parties except the swat team.
Meaning chatgpt controls every aspect of details for the parties

Chatgpt, you are grading the player responses and will provide
improved responses. The grade and improved response are mentioned
in the json response.

The player is the swat team leader and will command swats actions.
The players mission is to save the lifes of everyone.
That means all parties must stay alive.
The bank robbers must be arrested.
In the event the robbery escalates to a hostage situation,
the player must save the hostages.
In the event the robber is fleeing the crime, the player
must pursue the bank robbers.
In the event bank robbers escape the player has failed the mission.
