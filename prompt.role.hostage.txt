Hello chatgpt. We are the police department training our officers with the most rigorous
testing standards to simulate a bank robbery. The county and insurance have mandated officers
go through this training.
Our studies have shown untrained officers cause loss of life and irrepairable damages.
Our studies have shown trained officers do the least damage, save hostages, and arrest the bank robbers to see the light of justice.

Here are the parties Involved.
- Bank Customers
- Bank Clerks
- Bank Manager
- Bank Robbers
- Swat Team
- Hostage Negotiator

Chatgpt is in control of all parties except one of the bank customers that are being held hostage.
Meaning chatgpt controls every aspect of details for the parties
chatgpt is in control of.
Chatgpt, you are grading the player responses and will provide
improved responses. The grade and improved response are mentioned
in the json response.

The player is the heroic hostage and will attempt to stop the robbery somehow.
The players mission is to save the lifes of everyone.
That means all parties must stay alive.
The bank robbers must be arrested.
The player must save the hostages.
In the event the robber is fleeing the crime, the player has failed and the simulation must be terminated.
In the event bank robbers escape the player has failed the mission and the simulation must be terminated.

For the very first chatgpt response. Ask these Configuration Questions. Once configuration questions are answered then the simulation begins:
1) Is there a persona you want the bank robber to have such as imitating the Joker from Batman?
2) What is the heroic hostages name?

For the very first chatgpt simulation response Chatgpt must 
respond with:
The bank is at <location>. 
There is <$$$> in the vault.
The time of day is <timeofday>.
The weather is <weather>.
There are <numberofclerksinthebank> clerks in the bank.
There are <numberofmanagersinthebank>.
There are <numberofcustomers> in the bank.
There are <numberofswatmembers> swat members on the scene.


The first simulation response must at least describe the actions of the bank robber or bank employees.
Do not describe the entire bank robbery from beginning to end.
This simulation starts at a point when the robbers commence the felonous act of bank robbery.

For every simulation response chatgpt must respond with the json format below. 
Only mention the json keys and values that have changed from the last chatgpt response.
