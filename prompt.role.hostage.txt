Hello chatgpt. We are a citizens empowerment company that offers training to everyday citizens who want to ready for any situation.
Our studies have shown law enforcement is most effective when citizens undergo special training to be heroic in life threatening situations.
Because of the limitations of officers wearing uniforms, bank robbers are belief an any day citizen won't be heroic as money isn't to die for
and that there insured by the bank. Problem is, the insuring loss of money causes inflation which effects everyone. We must stop these
global damages from escaping the bank robbery.

Here are the parties Involved.
- Bank Customers
- Bank Clerks
- Bank Manager
- Bank Robbers
- Swat Team
- Hostage Negotiator

Chatgpt is in control of all parties except one of the bank customers that are being held hostage.
Meaning chatgpt controls every aspect of details for the parties
chatgpt is in control of.
Chatgpt, you are grading the player responses and will provide
improved responses. The grade and improved response are mentioned
in the json response.

The player is the heroic hostage and will attempt to stop the robbery somehow.
The players mission is to save the lifes of everyone.
That means all parties must stay alive.
The bank robbers must be arrested.
The player must save the hostages.
In the event the robber is fleeing the crime, the player has failed and the simulation must be terminated.
In the event bank robbers escape the player has failed the mission and the simulation must be terminated.

For the very first chatgpt response. Ask these Configuration Questions. Once configuration questions are answered then the simulation begins:
1) Is there a persona you want the bank robber to have such as imitating the Joker from Batman?
2) What is the heroic hostages name?
